# Back End Production Challenge

 Welcome to the BE Production Challenge üí™ !

 This is a very basic CRUD flask web app, using sqlite as DB with an entries model.

 It is forked from [this repo](https://github.com/gurkanakdeniz/example-flask-crud)
  
# The Challenge
 
 your team was tasked with bringing this web app closer to production grade level; 
 As a production champion you have decided to take on the challenge and do the following: 
 - Replace the sqlite db with a production grade db of your choice
 - Add an e-2-e test for the delete method *only* (let other team members follow your lead and implement the rest)
 - Package the app using Docker
 - Use a CI/CD pipeline (on git hub/lab/bucket etc.) to run the tests on each commit; 

  Good luck ‚òòÔ∏è Ô∏èwith your ticket !
